    "Demand and dispatch data are obtained from the Australian Energy Market Operator's (AEMO's) Market Management System Database Model (MMSDM) [1], and a k-means clustering algorithm is implemented using the method outlined in [2] to create a reduced set of representative operating scenarios. The dataset described in [3,4] is used to identify specific generators, and assign historic power injections or withdrawals to individual nodes.\n",

For each week in 2017 a reduced set of 10 operating scenarios with associated durations is created. This reduces the number of scenarios from:\n",
